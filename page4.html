                Apart from the seasons when the hair falls twice a year, it does not need to be decorated. We suggest brushing with a special metal comb. In hot seasons, try to use a cooler so that it doesn't bother you. The Siberian Husky has a thicker coat than the others, and of course, a much more varied color in the outer coat is found in this breed.
                The outer coating is in two layers, the thicker and denser layer is placed below and the thinner layer, which has more polish, is placed on top. This cover easily tolerates cold up to 60 degrees Celsius below zero in Siberian winters, and of course, it is a very good reflector for heat in summers. The outer coat of this breed needs regular brushing.
